# ADVANCED

# For problems 12-15, use the following line of code:

# Problem 12
# Research to find the Python method that allows you to add an element to the end of the array (similar to push() in JavaScript), then add a name to the end of the `friends` array.

# Problem 13
# Print out the total amount of elements in the `friends` array. The Python method you are looking for is similar to the JavaScript property `.length`.

# Add a name into the third position in the array (index 2). Make sure you are not overwriting the value that is already there.
